# FusionPBX + ASTPP Ansible Role

An ansible role to install [FusionPBX](http://www.fusionpbx.com/) and [ASTPP](http://www.astpp.org/)
on a debian-based system using the FusionPBX and FreeSWITCH debian packages. While not perfect, it's
pretty good and improving. Pull requests are always welcome, issues as well (although I may not get
right on fixing them).

*The ASTTP branch is untested and still under development*
